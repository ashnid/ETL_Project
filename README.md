# ETL_Project

Project Description/Outline:
Our goal is to analyze the historical data (2012-2017) from both the S&P 500 index and bitcoin cryptocurrency to determine which would have been a better investment.


Research Questions:
Which of the 2 was more profitable between the years 2012-2017?
Was one a more volatile/inconsistent investment than the other? 
Did either dramatically increase or decrease over a short period of time?
